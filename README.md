=================

Compilation instructions for Linux:
1. Clone repo
2. Add the json-io library jar as lib/json-io.jar (download: http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.cedarsoftware/json-io/)
3. Add the miglayout jar as lib/miglayout-swing.jar (download: http://www.migcalendar.com/miglayout/versions/4.0/miglayout-4.0-swing.jar)
4. If you already have the Arduino IDE *OR* librxtx-java installed, you can probably skip this step. If not,
install librxtx-java (version 2.2pre2). If for some reason you don't get RXTXcomm.jar in /usr/share/java, place it there manually or change its location in the build path to wherever you have it.
5. Compile!

Not tested under Windows yet, sorry! :( Will try to try it ASAP.
